  <p align="left">Several popular formats exist for digital image files, usually 
  referred to by the file extension used. The more common formats include BMP, 
  JPG, GIF, and PNG. As is typically the case, there are pros and cons 
  associated with each format. From the standpoint of gaining familiarity with 
  the subject of image files, the Windows BMP file offers significant advantages 
  because of its simplicity. It also has the advantage of being highly 
  standardized and extremely widespread. Its principal disadvantage is that it does 
  not support effective image compression except on specific types of images. 
  However, there is a hidden benefit to this shortcoming: since other image file 
  formats do offer significant data compression, very few images stored in BMP 
  format are compressed and, therefore, a very simple BMP editor that doesn't 
  support working with compressed BMP files will seldom encounter a file it 
  can't work with.</p>
  <p align="left">The information contained here is rather minimal. A much more 
  thorough treatment of image file formats can be found in such texts as <i>
  Compressed File Formats </i>by John Miano. An excellent and in-depth 
	description of the Windows BMP file format can be found
	<a href="http://www.fileformat.info/format/bmp/egff.htm">here</a>.</p>
  <p align="left">The Windows BMP file format dates back nearly two decades and 
  several incompatible versions existed at one time. However, since Microsoft 
  has full control of the format definition, these older forms are virtually 
  never encountered and the format has been very stable since the version 
  released with Windows 3.0 (Version 3). Certainly enhancements have been added to the 
  format definition since then, but they have occurred in an upwardly compatible 
  fashion; furthermore, none of those enhancements have really gained much 
	traction so, once again, a simple editor that can only work with the basic 
	options will seldom encounter difficulties. At the time of this writing, 
	there were Versions 4 and 5 of the specification that support various 
	aspects of the graphics libraries found in later versions of Windows, but 
	virtually all editors still limit themselves to the Version 3 format.</p>
	<p align="left">We can get a useful idea of what options should be supported 
	by looking at which options are supported by Paint, the simple image editor 
	that comes with Windows. Version 5.1 (which shipped with Windows XP) 
	supports Monochrome, 16-color, 256-color, and 24-bit color. These are the 
	1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, and 24-bit options, respectively. We will therefore 
	describe these in detail. In addition, we will include 16-bit and 32-bit 
	options; even though these are almost never encountered in practice, they 
	use the concept of color bitmasks which are useful to at least know about.</p>
	<p align="left">Even though the file format does support a very primitive 
	type of compression, we will not go into that here. As mentioned previously, 
	these options are almost never used since people usually use another format 
	such as PNG for JPG if they want compression.</p>
  <p align="left">The basic file structure is binary (as opposed to a text file) 
	and is broken into the following four sections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p class="style3" align="left">The File Header (14 bytes)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Confirms that the file is (at least 
			probably) a BMP file.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Tells exactly how large the file is.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Tells where the actual image data is 
			located within the file. </p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="style3" align="left">The Image Header (40 bytes in the 
		versions of interest)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Tells how large the image is (rows 
			and columns).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Tells what format option is used 
			(bits per pixel).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Tells which type of compression, if 
			any, is used.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Provides other details, all of which 
			are seldom used.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="style3" align="left">The Color Table (length varies and is not 
		always present)</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Provides the color palette for bit 
			depths of 8 or less.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Provides the (optional) bit masks for 
			bit depths of 16 and 32.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Not used for 24-bit images.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p class="style3" align="left">The Pixel Data</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Pixel by pixel color information</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Row-by-row, bottom to top.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Rows start on double word (4-byte) 
			boundaries and are null padded if necessary.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">Each row is column-by-column, left to 
			right.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">In 24-bit images, color order is Red, 
			Green, Blue.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="style3" align="left">In images less than 8-bits, the 
			higher order bits are the left-most pixels.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="style3" align="left">Each of these four sections is discussed in detail below.</p>
	<p class="style3" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
	<p class="style3" align="left">Endianness - Since this is a Microsoft format 
	specification originally targeted for Intel processors, most multibyte 
	values are stored in Little Endian format. This means that the bytes within 
	the value are stored starting with the least significant byte first and the 
	most significant byte last. Since this is how multibyte values are 
	represented internally on an Intel processor, you will not need to worry 
	about this convention as long as you transfer multibyte values directly 
	between the file and memory. The only exception to this rule is for 16-bit 
	pixel data in the WinNT version, which is stored in Big Endian. Note that 
	ASCII character strings are not multibyte values -- they are strings of 
	single-byte characters -- and, hence, the very concept of Endianness does 
	not apply to them.</p>

  <p align="left">The File Header has exactly fourteen bytes separated into five 
	fields.</p>

  </tbody></table>
  <h3 align="left">bfType</h3>
	<p align="left">The first 
  two bytes must be the ASCII codes for the characters 'B' and 'M'. The software 
  should check these values to confirm that the file it is reading is most 
  probably a Windows BMP file. There are actually other options for these two 
	characters, but they all refer to formats developed for the OS/2 operating 
	system, which is largely extinct. </p>
	<h3 align="left">bfSize</h3>
	<p align="left">The second field is a four-byte integer that 
  contains the size of the file in bytes. In theory, this means that a BMP file 
	could be as large as 4GB (4,294,967,296 bytes), however it is not safe to 
	assume that all editors will treat this as an unsigned value and therefore a 
	more reasonable limit is 2GB (2,147,483,648 bytes). This can accommodate a 
	24-bit image that contains over 715 million pixels (e.g., a picture larger 
	than 32,000 by 23,000 pixels). It is probably worth noting that the BMP file 
	specification actually supports storing multiple images in a single file; 
	however, this is almost never done and very few editors support this option.</p>
	<h3 align="left">bfReserved1</h3>
	<h3 align="left">bfReserved2</h3>
	<p align="left">The third and fourth fields are each 
  two bytes long and are reserved for future extensions to the format 
  definition. While certainly not impossible, it is unlikely at this point that 
	either will ever be used. The present definition requires that both of these fields be zero. 
	A well-written reader should behave reasonably if non-zero values are 
	encountered, but what is "reasonable"? Should the reader ignore the values 
	regardless of what they are, or should it refuse to proceed any further on 
	the assumption that the file conforms to a later version of the format 
	specification and that it has no basis for assuming that it can properly 
	interpret the contents? Good arguments can be made for either approach. 
	Assuming that the decision is made to go ahead and read the file while 
	ignoring these values, what should happen when the file is written back to 
	disk? Should these values be forced to zero, in order to conform to the 
	present specification, or should they be preserved assuming that they have 
	meaning to the program that originally generated the file? Again, good 
	arguments can be made either way.</p>
	<h3 align="left">bfOffBits</h3>
	<p align="left">The final four byte field is an integer that gives the offset of the start of 
  the Pixel Data section relative to the start of the file.</p>
  <hr>
  <h1 align="left"><a name="The Image Header">The Image Header</a></h1>
  <p align="left">There are actually several options for the Image 
Header, 
	particularly when Versions 4 and 5 of the specification are considered.
 
	Limiting the discussion to Version 3, there are still two distinct 
options: 
  one that was developed for the OS/2 BMP format and one that is for the
 Windows 
  BMP format. The OS/2 Image Header is exactly 12 bytes long while the 
Windows 
  Image Header is at least 40 bytes long. Fortunately, the first four 
bytes of 
  each format (including Versions 4 and 5 and, probably, all future 
versions) is the length of the Image Header in bytes and therefore a 
simple 
  examination of this value tells you which format is being used. While 
the 
  Windows Image Header allows headers longer than 40 bytes (and this was
 
  supported by Windows 95), few applications ever adopted it and, once 
again, an 
	editor that restricts itself to only working with 40-byte Image Headers
 will 
	likely never encounter a file it can't work with.</p>
  <p align="left">The following is the format for the basic 40-byte Windows 
	Image Header.</p>

  </tbody></table>
  <h3 align="left">biSize</h3>
	<p align="left">The size, in bytes, of the Image Header. Nearly all BMP 
	files use the basic 40-byte header from the Windows Version 3 specification.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biWidth</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the width of the image, in pixels.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biHeight</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the height of the image, in pixels. The pixel data 
	is ordered from bottom to top. If this value is negative, then the data is 
	ordered from top to bottom. </p>
	<h3 align="left">biPlanes</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the number of image planes in the image. It is 
	always equal to 1.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biBitCount</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the number of bits used to represent the data for 
	each pixel. Bit Counts of 8 or less are "indexed" with the data being an 
	index into the color pallete that is located stored in the Color Table 
	section. Bit Counts greater than 8 are considered to be "true color" data 
	with the complete color information being contained in each pixel's data. 
	The overwhelming number of true color BMP files contain 24-bit images in 
	which each pixel is represented by three bytes of data with one byte each 
	for red, green, and blue intensities; no Color Table is present for such an 
	image. Bit counts of 16 and 32 are color-masked bit fields and although all 
	of the color data is present for each pixel, a set of three bit-masks, one 
	for each primary color, is needed in order to determine which bits 
	correspond to which colors; these bitmasks are stored in the Color Table 
	section (with a default set of color masks being used if no Color Table is 
	present).</p>
	<h3 align="left">biCompression</h3>
	<p align="left">This value indicates what type of compression, if any, is 
	used. The possible values are:</p>

	</tbody></table>
	<h3 align="left">biSizeImage</h3>
	<p align="left">This indicates the size of the actual pixel data, in bytes, 
	stored in the file. It is required for compressed image types. For 
	uncompressed types (including bit-fielded images) it is generally set equal 
	to zero since the size of the data can be calculated directly from the image 
	size and width.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biXPelsPerMeter</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the preferred horizontal resolution of the image, in 
	pixels per meter, when it is printed or displayed. It is only recommendation 
	to the display device and is generally equal to zero, indicating no 
	preference.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biYPelsPerMeter</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the preferred vertical resolution of the image, in 
	pixels per meter, when it is printed or displayed. It is only recommendation 
	to the display device and is generally equal to zero, indicating no 
	preference.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biClrUsed</h3>
	<p align="left">This value is zero except for indexed images using fewer 
	than the maximum number of colors, in which case it refers to the number of 
	colors contained in the Color Table. For the indexed bit depths (i.e., Bit 
	Counts of 8 and smaller) the Color Table contains a list of colors to which 
	the pixel data refer. The maximum number of colors that can be used is 2<sup><em>N</em></sup> 
	where <em>N</em> is the value of Bit Count. For instance, 8-bit images can 
	support a maximum of 256 colors. But suppose that an image only uses 47 
	colors. Why store 256? More to the point, why have to make up 109 colors 
	that aren't being used? Instead, simply set this parameter to 47 and store 
	those 47 colors and no more. </p>
	<p align="left">In practice it is very uncommon to run across images that 
	have anything other than zero for this parameter. The reason is that it is a 
	simple matter to go ahead and set all of the unused colors to all zero 
	(black) -- or some other color -- and store all 2<sup><em>N</em></sup> of 
	them in the Color Table. The space penalty is negligible since the file size 
	is dominated by the pixel data for all but the smallest images.</p>
	<h3 align="left">biClrImportant</h3>
	<p align="left">This is the number of colors that are considered important 
	when rendering the image. For instance, an image might contain 47 different 
	colors but perhaps a reasonable image can be generated using just 13 of 
	them. If the image is displayed on hardware having very limited color 
	capability, say a cheap LCD panel supporting only 16 colors, then the reader 
	knows that it should be able to generate an acceptable image by just using 
	the first 16 colors in the Color Table. Needless to say, the important 
	colors need to be stored first in the Color Table for this to work. It is 
	left up to the application reading the file to determine how to map the 
	"unimportant" colors into the available ones. </p>
	<p align="left">If this parameter is equal to zero, then all colors in the 
	Color Table are to be considered important. </p>
	<hr>
	<h1 align="left"><a name="The Color Table">The Color Table</a></h1>
  <p align="left">If we are dealing with images having a bit depth of 8 or less, 
	then the pixel data is actually an index into a color palette. For instance, 
	in a 4-bit image there are a maximum of 16 colors in the palette. If the 
	data for a particular pixel is, say, 9, then the color that is used for that 
	pixel is given by the tenth entry in the table (because the numbering starts 
	with 0 and not 1). </p>
	<p align="left">In all versions of BMP files starting with Version 3 
	(Win3x), the color entries occupy 4 bytes each so that they can be 
	efficiently read and written as single 32-bit values. Taken as a single 
	value, the four bytes are ordered as follows: [ZERO][RED][GREEN][BLUE]. Due 
	to the Little Endian format, this means that the Blue value comes first 
	followed by the green and then the red. A fourth, unused, byte comes next 
	which is expected to be equal to 0.</p>
	<p align="left">If we are dealing with 16-bit or 32-bit images, then the 
	Color Table contains a set of bit masks used to define which bits in the 
	pixel data to associate with each color. Note that the original Version 3 
	BMP format did not support these image types. Instead, these were an 
	extension of the format developed for WindowsNT. For both the 16-bit and the 
	32-bit variants, the color masks are 32-bits long with the green mask being 
	first and the blue mask being last. In both cases the bit masks start with 
	the most significant bits, meaning that for the 16-bit images the least 
	significant two bytes are zero. The format requires that the bits in each 
	mask be contiguous and that the masks be non-overlapping. The most common 
	bit masks for 16-bit images are RGB555 and RGB565 while the most common 
	bitmasks for 32-bit images are RGB888 and RGB101010.</p>

  <h1 align="left"><a name="The Pixel Data">The Pixel Data</a></h1>
  <p>The pixel data is organized in rows from bottom to top and, within each 
	row, from left to right. Each row is called a "scan line". If the image 
	height is given as a negative number, then the rows are ordered from top to 
	bottom.</p>
	<p>In the uncompressed formats (including the color masked formats) each 
	scan line is null-padded so as to occupy an integer number of dwords (4-byte 
	words). In other words, the number of bytes needed to store each scan line 
	must be an even multiple of four and, if necessary, null bytes (bytes whose 
	values are zero) are appended to the end of the pixel data for that row in 
	order to make this so. For instance, in the 24-bit format each pixel 
	requires three bytes of data. If the image is 13 pixels wide then each row 
	requires 39 bytes of data and a single null byte would be appended to bring 
	this total to 40.</p>
	<h3>1-bit (Monochrome Bitmap)</h3>
	<p>Each byte of data represents 8 pixels. The most significant bit maps to 
	the left most pixel in the group of eight. Any unused bits are set to zero.</p>
	<h3>4-bit (16 Color Bitmap)</h3>
	<p>Each byte of data represents 2 pixels. The most significant nibble maps 
	to the left most pixel in the group of two. Any unused nibble is set to 
	zero.</p>
	<h3>8-bit (256 Color Bitmap)</h3>
	<p>Each byte represents 1 pixel. </p>
	<h3>16-bit (Up to 65,536 Colors, but commonly 32,768 Colors)</h3>
	<p>Each pixel is represented by two bytes. A common representation is RGB555 
	which allocates 5 bits to each color allowing for 32K colors while leaving 
	one bit unused. Since the eye is most sensitive to green, another common 
	representation is RGB565 which allocates this unused bit to the green 
	component </p>
	<h3>24-bit (16,777,216 Colors)</h3>
	<p>Each pixel is represented by three bytes. The first byte gives the 
	intensity of the red component, the second byte gives the intensity of the 
	green component, and the third byte gives the intensity of the blue 
	component.</p>
	<h3>32-bit (Up to 4,294,967,296 Colors, but commonly 1,073,741,824 or 
	16,777,216 Colors)</h3>
	<p>Each pixel is represented by four bytes. Even though this means that over 
	four billion colors could be represented, very few display devices are 
	capable of such resolution. However, it can be desirable to store images 
	with such high resolution so that significant processing can be performed on 
	the data without significant degradation building up from accumulated 
	round-off errors. Even so, it is generally sufficient to only maintain an 
	additional two bits of information per pixel, so the RGB101010 
	representation allocates 10 bits to each color. Another common 
	representation is the RGB888 which simply uses a 32-bit format to store 
	24-bit images in order to leverage the ability of the processor to work with 
	data in 32-bit chunks more efficiently.</p>
