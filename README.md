This program will encode/decode messages into/from a given bmp picture file via these methods:

Simple LSB, 
  Monochrome LSB, 
    Simple Random Monochrome LSB, 
      Random Monochrome LSB, 
        Chromatic Keyed LSB

The user will provide the key if needed, method of encoding or decoding, and the file path for the image. 
If the user is encoding a message into the picture, they will have to provide the desired message as well.
