This program will encode/decode messages into/from a given picture via:

LSB hijack monochrome and LSB hijack chromatic keyed methods.

The user will provide the key, method of encoding or decoding, and the file path for the image. If the user is encoding a message into the picture, they will have to provide the desired message as well.
